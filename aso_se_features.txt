[h1]Astro's Stellaris Overhaul - Space Exploration[/h1]
This mod is intended to make exploring space more fun and interesting, and maybe also a little more mysterious.
Note: Should be compatible with virtually any other mod that doesn't edit vanilla anomaly/precursor events or mess with vanilla sensor game rules.
